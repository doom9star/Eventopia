Planning an event is a monotonous task. Some of the caveats include:
● Inadequate Budget
● Venue Selection
● Inviting Guests
● Transportation
● Time Constraint
● Theme / Design
● Technology
● Weather Fluctuation
● Food, etc
Inferior planning could possibly escalate the probability of occurrence of unexpected
behaviors during the event. This is where our product ‘Eventopia’ comes to the
rescue.
We provide a platform for people who expertise in planning to register as planners
to orchestrate the events of the customers. People who desire to conduct an event
but lack the expertise to plan can approach our registered planners to successfully
manage their events.
