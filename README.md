##### Planning an event is a monotonous task. Some of the caveats include:

<ul>
  <li>Inadequate Budget</li>
  <li>Venue Selection</li>
  <li>Inviting Guests</li>
  <li>Transportation</li>
  <li>Time Constraint</li>
  <li>Theme / Design</li>
  <li>Technology</li>
  <li>Weather Fluctuation</li>
  <li>Food, etc</li>
</ul>

##### Inferior planning could possibly escalate the probability of occurrence of unexpected behaviors during the event. **This is where our product ‘Eventopia’ comes to the rescue.**

##### We provide a platform for people who expertise in planning to register as planners to orchestrate the events of the customers. People who desire to conduct an event but lack the expertise to plan can approach our registered planners to successfully manage their events.
